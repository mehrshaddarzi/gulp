Improving Your Workflow with Gulp.js - Working Files
====================================================

Chapters 3 to 7 provide a single page demonstration website at various stages of development with the appropriate Gulp tasks defined.

Files are contained in a `mysite` folder with all the assets for the lesson. You can install these on any Windows, Mac or Linux PC.

1. Copy the lesson's `mysite` folder to your local system, e.g.

  `C:\projects\mysite` on Windows, or
  `~/projects/mysite` on Mac/Linux

2. Navigate to that folder from your terminal/command line, e.g. on Windows:

    c:
    cd \projects\mysite

  or Mac/Linux:

    cd ~/projects/mysite

3. Install the Node dependencies defined in `package.json`. On Windows:

    npm install

  or Mac/Linux:

    sudo npm install

You can now run the Gulp.js tasks described in the lesson, e.g.

    gulp
